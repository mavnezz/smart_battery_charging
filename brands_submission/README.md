# Brands Repo Submission

This folder contains the files for submitting to the Home Assistant Brands repository.

## How to submit:

1. Fork https://github.com/home-assistant/brands
2. Copy the `smart_battery_charging` folder to `custom_integrations/smart_battery_charging/` in your fork
3. Create a Pull Request

## Files:
- `icon.png` - 256x256px PNG icon (required)
- `logo.png` - Landscape logo, 256px shortest side (optional, can be added later)

## After PR is merged:
The brands validation check in HACS will pass automatically.

## Note:
This is optional for custom HACS integrations. The integration works fine without it.
